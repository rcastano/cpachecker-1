To see the original README.txt file, please look at cpachecker_files/README.txt.

This branch contains additional files necessary to reproduce our experiments.

To reproduce the experiments end-to-end, we provide the scripts run_experiments900.sh. These scripts have not been heavily tested, please contact us if any problems should arise or for additional information.

Note: Ignore warnings about missing property files. Specifications are set using command line options instead of the standard benchexec mechanism, triggering the warning. This is necessary due to differences in the language supported in property files compared to CPAchecker specifications.
