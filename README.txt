This branch contains additional files necessary to reproduce our experiments.

To reproduce the experiments end-to-end, we provide the scripts run_experiments10800.sh and run_experiments900.sh. These scripts have not been heavily tested, please contact us if any problems should arise.

For the case studies in particular, we also include the assumption automata generated by the initial verification phase so that it is only necessary to run the significantly shorter witness generation phase.
The script reproduce_case_studies.sh runs only the witness generation phase and the corresponding post-processing (This might take several minutes).
For each case study, 4 files are generated, corresponding to the safe, unexplored, explored and emptiness components of the execution report.
The 3 case studies included are "keyspan", "mem_slave_2" and "combined". The files for keyspan will be keyspan_input_emptiness.txt, keyspan_input_safe.txt, keyspan_input_explored.txt and keyspan_input_unexplored.txt.
Each of the components can be explored in detail with the script util/handle_witnesses.py as follows:
python util/handle_witnesses.py keyspan_input_unexplored.txt 
The script accepts several commands such as:
print -- print all witnesses
collapse -- collapse a range of lines from a certain witness
d -- collapses all method calls nested in the call stack deeper than a certain level
Feel free to contact us for additional information.

Note: The script reproduce_case_studies.sh will output ERROR for the instances where the appropriate assumption automaton is not provided and is expected. For example, for the run set "produce-witnesses-explored-explicit-from-explicit.case_studies", the instance mem_slave_tlm.2.c will output error, because we don't provide the assumption automaton generated by explicit value analysis, we only provide the file case_studies/fse12/systemc/mem_slave_tlm2.c.predicate.assumption_automaton, corresponding to predicate analysis.
